#all about RBscriptJottings

# Introduction #

This is just a placeholder page for now.


# Details #

This open-source project was started by Steve Garman
and is intended to provide a framework in which those
who use RBScript can share the stuff they find out with
the RB community.

At the time of writing, this consists of one project with
a couple of windows.

Each mini-project consists of an rbscript subclass
(preferably with the ultimate parent
RBSbasicMod.RBSbasic), a context class
(preferably with the ultimate parent
RBSbasicMod.RBScontextBasic) and a window with (at a
minimum) an EditField or TextArea for script source
and a "run" button. This is basically a demo setup.

The idea is that a contributor can either help to
complete an existing mini-project (such as
RBScontrols or start a new mini-project and add
a button to winMainMenu to call her demo window.

To get the idea, download the source and see what is
there so far.
