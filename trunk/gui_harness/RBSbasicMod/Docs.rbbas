		This open-source project was started by Steve Garman
		and is intended to provide a framework in which those 
		who use RBScript can share the stuff they find out with 
		the RB community.
		
		At the time of writing, this consists of one project with
		a couple of windows.
		
		Each mini-project consists of an rbscript subclass 
		(preferably with the ultimate parent
		RBSbasicMod.RBSbasic), a context class 
		(preferably with the ultimate parent 
		RBSbasicMod.RBSbasic) and a window with (at a
		minimum) an EditField or TextArea for script source
		and a "run" button. This is basically a demo setup.
		
		The idea is that a contributor can either help to 
		complete an existing mini-project (such as 
		RBScontrols or start a new mini-project and add
		a button to winMainMenu to call her demo window.
		
		To get the idea, download the source and see what is 
		there so far.
